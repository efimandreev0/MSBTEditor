# MSBTEditor
The msbt text extractor/replacer by c++
It can extract and replace .msbt and .umsbt LE-files.
Now it supports extracting only txt2-block (with text).
You can extract text without tags or delete tags what you don't want. Just place the group of tag into "SkipTags.txt"
e.x.: you need ignore <7.0:8:0>, so Place here 7. Or you need ignore tags <5.8> just Place here 5 on the new string.
# In-future
Do extracting with styles, attributes and labels.
